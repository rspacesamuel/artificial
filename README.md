interview-chat.py

RAG -> OpenAI API

Context Chunking -> Langchain

Vector DB -> ChromaDB

Embedding model -> OpenAI

Chat interface -> gradio

LLM -> GPT-4o


The chatbot acts as a job candidate, where a user can interview (ask questions) about the candidate.
I prompted 4o to be creative if context isn't enough but asked it to add "Alright" when it's trying to be creative.
Then I confronted it about the "Alright" usage while chatting. 4o gracefully dealt with the situation.

In case you didn't already say Eww I will say it: this is not professional grade code. Eg secret management, environment management, exceptions etc. aren't properly handled.

I wrote this up just to feel nostalgic in case this AI thing fully takes over coding!
